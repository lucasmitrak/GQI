These are configs for many different setups. If you have a similar setup, please review the config and run a diff(diff ../installer/config.sh qemu/installer/config.sh) to see the differences. You could literally just copy the configs(cp -r qemu/* ..) and work from there, but beware that networking, drive names, cpu count, and others will be different and so wont work. You still need to go through each of the three parts and review the configs and the filer's "files". However, qemu is most likely to work just by copying the configs and running filer.sh/kfragmenter.sh and then all three copy.sh immediately: then copy the "finished" directory onto the computer with the gentoo install CD and run "begin.sh"
