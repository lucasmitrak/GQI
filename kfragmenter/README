This part of the GQI is optional but neccessary if you are using lvm, or crypt, unless you are using your own custom kernel, more on that next paragraph. Enable the desired kernel fragments you want to appear in your kernel. After this, run copy.sh which will copy the kernel fragment to the "finished" directory. In addition, make sure to set "kernel_fragment_dir" to "." in the installer's config.sh.
The kernel fragment will merge with whatever kernel config is present. By default, this will be the default kernel config. However, if you set "kernel_dir" or "kernel_http" in the installer's config.sh to where a kernel config can be found, then the custom kernel config will be copied over and the kernel fragment will be merged with that. If you have no "kernel_fragment_dir" or "kernel_fragment_http" set, then the custom kernel will be used if you set one.
